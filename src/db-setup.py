**[기사 요약]**

서울 성북구는 길음청년창업거리에 청년들의 창업 부담을 줄이고 다양한 실험을 할 수 있는 공간인 '공업사'를 운영합니다. '공업사'는 '공들여 일하는 공간', '함께 일하는 공간', '새로운 일을 만들어내는 공간' 등 다양한 의미를 담고 있으며, 팝업 스토어 형태로 운영됩니다.

청년들은 이곳에서 창업 아이템을 실제 사업으로 연결하거나, 취미로 만든 물건을 판매하고, 온라인 판매 제품의 오프라인 반응을 살필 수도 있습니다. 또한, 공간이 부족해 운영하지 못했던 프로그램을 진행할 기회도 얻을 수 있습니다.

성북구 청년이라면 누구나 '공업사' 인스타그램을 통해 1~2개월간 공간 사용 신청이 가능하며, 패션 잡화, 홈/리빙, 의류, 출판물, 수공예품 등 다양한 상품 판매, 전시, 프로그램 운영이 가능합니다.

현재 '공업사'에서는 '나를 빛나게 하는 일상의 기술'이라는 테마로 10월 14일까지 판매가 진행 중이며, 9월에는 '수풀림(수공예 주얼리)', '오늘날(업사이클링 악세사리)', '종종스튜디오(캐릭터 상품)', '콤팍트(오브젝트)', '컴포트타올(우크라이나 기부 굿즈)' 등 5팀이 참여했습니다.

지난 8월에는 'collettehr-엽서전'이라는 가오픈 프로그램도 성공적으로 진행되었습니다.

성북구는 길음역~미아초등학교 구간의 유해업소 환경 개선 사업의 일환으로 2021년 '길음청년창업거리'를 선포하고, 2019년부터 '청년창업가게'를 조성해왔습니다. 현재 7호점 오픈을 앞두고 있으며, 창업 교육 및 컨설팅을 위한 '청년공간 길이음'도 운영 중입니다. 이러한 노력으로 유해업소는 37개에서 15개로 감소했습니다.

성북구는 '공업사' 운영과 더불어 '별길마켓' 플리마켓 개최 등을 통해 길음청년창업거리를 더욱 활성화할 계획입니다.

이승로 성북구청장은 '공업사'가 청년들에게 도전의 기회를 제공하고 초기 창업의 어려움을 극복하는 데 기여하여 창업 경쟁력을 높이는 데 도움이 될 것으로 기대한다고 밝혔습니다.
